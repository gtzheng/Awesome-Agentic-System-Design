# üåü Awesome Agentic System Design
A curated collection of resources for **designing, evaluating, and deploying agentic AI systems**‚Äîcovering architecture patterns, frameworks, safety considerations, and real-world applications.

---

## üìù Motivation
AI agents are quickly moving from research prototypes to **real-world applications**, and with that shift comes a new challenge: **agentic system design**.  

Just as *machine learning system design* became a must-have skill for engineers and researchers, **agentic system design** is poised to be the next big area of demand. Companies are already looking for people who can reason about how agents should **plan, act, use tools, and collaborate in complex environments**.  

This repository helps you stay ahead of the curve‚Äîbringing together the most useful **resources, frameworks, and design patterns** to sharpen your skills for **future agentic system design interviews**.
